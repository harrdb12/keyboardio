/* All hardware libraries must define the following macros:
 * HARDWARE_IMPLEMENTATION - the name of your public object conforming to
 *   the 'class Hardware' interface below.
 * ROWS - the number of rows on the keyboard
 * COLS - the number of columns on the keyboard
 * LED_COUNT - the total number of LEDs on the keyboard (can be 0)
 * CRGB(r,g,b) - explained below

/**
 * Forward declaration of the cRGB structure.
 *
 * The base class does not define the cRGB structure, that is left up to the
 * individual Hardware libraries. We do a forward declaration here, because the
 * base hardware has methods that depend on a cRGB structure.
 *
 * The structure will need to have at least three members: r, g, and b -
 * compilation will fail otherwise.
 *
 * Despite its name, the members do not need to be in the order r g b -- most
 * likely they will be in an order that is convenient for the hardware. So
 * initializing a cRGB with a struct literal will give surprising results for any
 * colors where r, g, and b do not have the same value. Each Hardware library
 * defines a CRGB(r,g,b) macro which returns a literal cRGB with the given values.
