If you ever wanted to just repeat the last key pressed, no matter what it was,
this plugin is made for you. It allows you to configure a key that will repeat
whatever the last previously pressed key was. Of course, one can limit which
keys are remembered...

## Using the plugin

To use the plugin, we'll need to enable it, and configure a key to act as the
"redial" key. This key should be on the keymap too.

```c++
#include <Kaleidoscope.h>
#include <Kaleidoscope-Redial.h>
#include <kaleidoscope-Ranges.h>

enum {
  REDIAL = kaleidoscope::ranges::SAFE_START,
};
#define Key_Redial (Key) {.raw = REDIAL}

// Place Key_Redial somewhere on the keymap...

void setup() {
  Kaleidoscope.use(&Redial);
  Redial.key = Key_Redial;

  Kaleidoscope.setup();
}
```

## Overrideable plugin methods

### `bool shouldRemember(Key mapped_key)`

> If one wants to change what keys the plugin remembers, simply override the
> `kaleidoscope::Redial::shouldRemember` function. Whenever a key is to be
> remembered, this function will be called with the key as argument. It should
> return `true` if the key should be remembered (and repeated by Redial),
> `false` otherwise.
>
> By default, the plugin will remember alphanumeric keys only.

## Plugin properties

The `Redial` object has only one property, the key to trigger it.

### `.key`

> The key to trigger the redial effect. Be aware that whatever key you specify
> here, will have its action shadowed by the redial functionality. Choose
> something unused, see the example sketch for one way to do that.
>
> There is no default.

started with the plugin.
